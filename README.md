#_printf: Replica of printf

This is variadic function whose purpose is printing input parameters following a format given as input.

##Available formats

Since this is a simplified version, the only formats available are int, char and char*.

##Files

Three scripts were used to compile this program. The first one (_putchar.c) is a replica of the putchar function, the second one (101-print_number.c) is a function that prints out an input integer, and the remaining one is the main script where the former scripts are called and that defines the function _printf.
